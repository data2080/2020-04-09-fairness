# Welcome to week 10

This week we will look at strategies for mitigating bias in machine learning and what their limitations might be.  We'll conclude with a discussion about what other techniques might help and how things like interpretability, explanation, or data provenance might supplement algorithmic solutions.

Read these two papers:
[A comparative study of fairness-enhancing interventions in machine learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287589) be prepared to critique the methodology of the evaluation. What additional things would you have done to evaluate the systems? What new questions do their results inspire?

[Fairness and Abstraction in Sociotechnical Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3287560.3287598) be prepared to generate concrete actions for a data scientist based on their recommendations for a more STS approach.

Read this [blog post on IBM's implementation of FairML tools](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/research/2018/09/ai-fairness-360/).

Optional, additional reading:
[Roles for computing in social change](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3351095.3372871)
